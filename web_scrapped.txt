# SuperKnowa 

**Fast Framework to build Enterprise RAG (Retriever Augmented Generation) Pipelines at Scale - powered by watsonx**

Welcome to the SuperKnowa GitHub repository! SuperKnowa framework accelerates your Enterprise Generative AI applications to get prod-ready solutions quickly on your private data. Here, you will find a diverse collection of pluggable components designed to tackle various Generative AI use cases using Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of these components as building blocks, much like Lego pieces, that you can assemble to address a wide range of challenges in the realm of AI-driven text generation. These are battle-tested from 1M to 200M private knowledge base & scaled to billions of retriever tokens. 

The overall pipeline of the SuperKnowa RAG framework & key building blocks:

## Getting Started

You can get started by updating the [`config.yaml`](./config.yaml) file and run the [LLMQnA.py](./4.%20In-context%20learning%20using%20LLM/LLMQnA.py) script for quickly configuring your RAG pipeline:

```
retriever:
  indexName: superknowa
  query: What is IBM Cloud?
  ....

reranker:
  query: What is IBM Data and Analytics Reference Architecture?
  ...

LLMQnA:
  question: What is IBM Data and Analytics Reference Architecture?
  ...
```

## AI Alignment Tool  
Measure the alignment of AI models on the metrics of helpfulness, harmfulness and accuracy by capturing human inputs. 

### Results Dashboard
Build your various online & offline experiments for evaluations and compare the AI alignment results using an interactive dashboard. 







## LLM Eval Toolkit 

### [Eval_Package](5.%20LLM%20Model%20Evaluations/I.%20LLM%20Eval%20Toolkit/Eval_Package)
  
The Eval_Package is a tool designed to evaluate the performance of the LLM (Language Model) on a dataset containing questions, context, and ideal answers. It allows you to run evaluations on various datasets and assess how well the Model generates the answer on dozens of statistical metrics like BLUE, ROUGE, etc. 

### Features 
   - Evaluate LLM Model on custom datasets: Use the Eval_Package to assess the performance of your Model on datasets of your choice.
   - Measure model accuracy: The package provides metrics to gauge the accuracy of the model-generated answers against the ideal answers.

## [MLflow_Package](5.%20LLM%20Model%20Evaluations/I.%20LLM%20Eval%20Toolkit/mlflow_package)

The MLflow_Package is a comprehensive toolkit designed to integrate the results from the Eval_Package and efficiently track and manage experiments. It also enables you to create a leaderboard for evaluation comparisons and visualize metrics through a dashboard.



### Features 
   - Statistical Metrics Supported are BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, SentenceSim Score, SimHash Score, Perplexity Score, BLEURT Score, F1 Score and BERT score.
   - Experiment tracking: Utilize MLflow to keep a record of experiments, including parameters, metrics, and model artifacts generated during evaluations.
   - Leaderboard creation: The package allows you to create a leaderboard, making it easy to compare the performance of different  Models across multiple datasets.
   - Metric visualization: Generate insightful charts and graphs through the dashboard, allowing you to visualize and analyze evaluation metrics easily.


# Enterprise LLM Use Cases
